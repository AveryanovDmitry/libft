# libft

This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that I’ll
be to use in several my other projects.

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. In this project I re-write those functions, understand them,
and learn to use them. This library will help you with all your future C projects.
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. But always, make sure to
check which functions are allowed
